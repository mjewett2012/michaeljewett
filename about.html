    <h1><span style="color: blue">About Me</span></span></h1>

        <p>For the past <strong>30 years</strong>, I have been a PC repair technician for various companies, such as <i>Hewlett-Packard,
        HelloTech, Staples,</i> and <i>CompUSA</i>. This has been a rewarding and successful career until the advent of Covid. Being 
        immunocompromised, I was ordered to stay home for two years while Covid rampaged through the world. This necessitated a career 
        change, so I am currently enrolled in the <i>College of Western Idaho</i>. As a student seeking an <em>Associate's Degree in 
        Software Development</em>, I am striving to generate a career that will allow me to work from home. Programming has been my 
        hobby since the late 90s when Multi-User Domains (MUDs), text-based gaming MMORPGs, were prolific. I taught myself the 
        <i>C programming language</i> by learning MUD code and ran a highly successful MUD for the next 12 years. In the following years, 
        my self-learning has touched on <i>HTML, CSS, Java,</i> and <i>MySQL</i>.</p>

    <h2><span style="color: blue">Gaming is my passion</span></h2>

         <p>Be it tabletop game systems, such as <i>Dungeons and Dragons, Cyberpunk, Shadowrun,</i> and <i>BattleTech</i> amongst many 
            others; video games on virtually every platform starting from the Atari Gaming System, all the way to the next gen consoles, 
            such as the PlayStation 5; and strategy card games like Magic the Gathering, I thrive in the design, creation, and experience 
            of games.</p>

    <h2><span style="color: blue">My vision</span></h2>

        <p>Combining my love of game theory, design, and creation with my <em>Associate's in Software Development Degree</em>, to produce 
            games that people would like to play, or to be part of a team that accomplishes that goal, is my ultimate dream. To work with 
            a company like <em>Square-Enix</em> or <em>Blizzard</em>, would be incredible beyond my wildest dreams./p>
